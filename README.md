Play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe!  

Dev Notes:
The focus of this project was modularization of Javascript code with factory functions and modules.  This means that the UI may not be the prettiest, but a lot of work was done under the hood to separate the JS code into sensical modules that interact with each other. I think a lot could be done to strengthen abstraction barriers in this code, but it is a great start after an introduction to factory functions and modules.
